The code for HW3 is under two directories, `task1` and `task2`. The corresponding directories contain the datasets necessary along with the python scripts and resulting plots.

The project is run with python 3.10.0.

The following files are relevant for each task:
- task1: `task1/kmeans_impl.py`, `task1/kmeans_stop_crit.py`
- task2: `task2/rec.py`
